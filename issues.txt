upgrading from webpack v2 to v4

react-toolbox problems

https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env/issues/32 => has info about many solutions (custom-properties, postcss-calc, variables, postcss-custom-properties preserve, nesting-rules)

1. extract-text-webpack-plugin => mini-css-extract-plugin

2. postcss-cssnext => postcss-preset-env, postcss-custom-properties, postcss-calc, postcss-color-function

3. Error: composition is only allowed when selector is single :local class name not in ".raised", ".raised" is weird

for css-loader, set modules to true
{
  loader: 'css-loader',
  options: {
    modules: true,
  }
}
